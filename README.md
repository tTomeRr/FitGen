## Reflection

This was my final project for my DevOps bootcamp. The main goal of the project was to create a Flask application with full CI/CD DevOps tools, utilizing the technologies we had learned so far.
After months of study, watching hundreds of lectures, and going through thousands of notes, this was my first real experience applying all the DevOps tools we've been taught.
During the process of completing the project, I encountered lot of problems and bugs. It was challenging, but overcoming these obstacles and progressing step by step towards completion was rewarding.
Although the project may not be the best in terms of performance and efficiency, I'm proud of myself for finishing it, I learned a lot,
and I'm looking forward to working on more projects and expanding my knowledge with additional tools as I continue my DevOps journey.
